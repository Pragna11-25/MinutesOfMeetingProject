# Quick Recap: Instant Meeting Insights

**Quick Recap: Instant Meeting Insights** is an AI-powered tool that automates meeting summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It extracts key discussion points, decisions, and action items from meeting transcripts or recordings, making meetings more efficient and accessible. The system streamlines communication, reduces manual effort, and enhances productivity in remote and hybrid work environments.

## Features
- **Automated Meeting Summarization** – Converts speech to text and generates concise summaries.
- **Key Points Extraction** – Identifies important discussion topics, decisions, and action items.
- **Cloud-Based & Scalable** – Designed for seamless processing of small meetings to large conferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Upload, process, and retrieve summaries through a simple web interface.
- **API Support** – Integrates with external platforms like Slack, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **NLP & AI Models:** OpenAI Whisper, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication
- **Task Management:** Celery, Redis

## Installation & Setup
### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd QuickRecap
```
### Install Dependencies
```sh
# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install 

# Backend dependencies
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the Application
```sh
# Start Backend (Flask)
cd backend
python app.py

# Start Frontend (React)
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Usage
1. Upload an audio or text file.
2. Process the file to generate a summary.
3. Retrieve and download the structured meeting summary.
4. Analyze extracted insights, key points, and decisions.

## Running AI Models for Summarization
Ensure the `uploads/` directory exists before running the AI model backend.
```sh
python backend/app.py
```
The API will process the uploaded file and return structured meeting summaries.
